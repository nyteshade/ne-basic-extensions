## Overview

@nejs/basic-extensions is a JavaScript library that provides a collection of essential extensions
to built-in JavaScript objects like Array, Object, Function, and Reflect. These extensions are
designed to enhance the native capabilities of JavaScript objects, providing developers with
additional utility methods for common tasks and improving code readability and efficiency.

## Features

  for easy access to the first and last elements.

- **Object Extensions**: Introduces utility functions to the Object class, such as methods for
  checking object types and manipulating properties.

- **Function Extensions**: Enriches the Function class with methods to identify function types,
  such as arrow functions, async functions, and bound functions.

- **Reflect Extensions**: Extends the Reflect object with advanced property interaction methods,
  including checks for the presence of multiple or specific keys.
